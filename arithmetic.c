Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a C program that uses the multiplication, division, modulus, addition, and subtraction operators:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 5;
    int mul = num1 * num2;
    int div = num1 / num2;
    int mod = num1 % num2;
    int add = num1 + num2;
    int sub = num1 - num2;

    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", mul);
    printf("Division: %d\n", div);
    printf("Modulus: %d\n", mod);
    printf("Addition: %d\n", add);
    printf("Subtraction: %d\n", sub);

    return 0;
}
```

This program declares two variables `num1` and `num2`, and then performs multiplication, division, modulus, addition, and subtraction using the respective operators. Finally, it prints the results. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with! ðŸ˜Š
